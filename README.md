# Pinescript indicators
This GitHub repository is for keeping the source code of the indicators that I have designed in Trading View. Pine script language is used to code these indicators.
To see my scripts in Trading View, you can refer to the link below.
<br>Reading the written indicator codes will also help you learn Pinascript with the help of examples.
