# ENVELOPE RSI - Buy Sell Signals

This indicator is primarily based on **Overbought** and **Oversold** conditions and is designed for **short-term trading**. It provides small but acceptable signals.

## Indicator Logic

### Buy Signal:
- The indicator waits for the instrument to be **oversold** from the RSI perspective.
- Then, if the chart crosses the **bottom line** of the Envelope indicator **from below**, a buy signal is issued.

### Sell Signal:
- The indicator waits for the instrument to be **overbought** from the RSI perspective.
- Then, if the chart crosses the **top line** of the Envelope indicator **from above**, a sell signal is issued.

The general foundation of this indicator is the **consonance between price movement and the RSI indicator**.

## Recommended Settings:
- **Time frame:** 15 minutes
- **Overbought Level:** 80
- **Oversold Level:** 25
- **RSI Length:** 8

This indicator can be used on various financial instruments, but it is **essential** to set appropriate **profit and loss limits**. The **profit-to-loss ratio** for this indicator can be **1:1**.
